        # But since we are proxying to FPM, we need to handle the PHP execution.
        # Actually, Nginx usually serves static files and passes .php to FPM.
        # BUT, since we have a separate container for FPM, we need to be careful.
        # The easiest way in a dev proxy is:
        # If it matches /api, rewrite it to index.php and pass to FPM?
        # No, standard is: location ~ \.php$ { ... }
    }
    
    # We need a robust way to handle this.
    # Approach:
    # 1. Any request to /api/* should be handled by Laravel.
    # 2. We use an alias or root.
    
    location ~ ^/api {
        root /var/www/html/public;

        # Usually Laravel routes are defined as Route::get('/search').
        # If we hit /api/search, Laravel sees /api/search.
        # In RouteServiceProvider, api routes are usually prefixed with 'api'.
        # So /api/search hits /api/search in Laravel. Perfect.
